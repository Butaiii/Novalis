# PublishDKP

This program takes a list of players followed by a number of points to award and submits them to WebDKP.

## Configuration


## Usage

The program takes an input in the following format.
<pre>[player], [points]</pre>
Where [player] represents the player's name and [points] is an integer representing the amount of points to be added to the player's WebDKP profile.

To use it simply enter a list such as the following and press the "Publish" button.

<pre>
TimeShift, 55
Thallen, 182
Unpleased, 505
</pre>

This will add the specified amount of points to the player on WebDKP. If the player doesn't exist in the WebDKP table they will be created.
