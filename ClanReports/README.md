# ClanReports

ClanReports generates HTML reports on clan activity. A number of these reports can be found at [ronin.henrya.org/reports](http://ronin.henrya.org/reports)

## Usage

Unlike the others, this program should be run from the command line. In terminal or command prompt enter the following command.
<pre>java -jar ClanReports.jar</pre>

Make sure that the path to the jar file is correct. It will take about 1-2 minutes before the report is finished.
